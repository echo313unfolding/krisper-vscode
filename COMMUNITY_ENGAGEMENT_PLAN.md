## Phase 2: Engagement (Week 3-4)
### Hackathon: "Code Poetry Slam"
- **Theme**: Write the most creative Bio_Poetica program
- **Prizes**: 
  - Most Poetic: Feature in official examples
  - Most Practical: Guest blog post
  - Most Creative: Custom KRISPER swag
- **Judges**: Include someone from GitHub Copilot team!

### Real-World Demos
1. **Healthcare**: "Compress DICOM images with plain English"
2. **Data Science**: "ML pipeline in 10 lines of poetry"
3. **DevOps**: "Server monitoring haikus"
4. **Education**: "Teaching kids to code with Bio_Poetica"

## Phase 3: Partnerships (Month 2)
### Target Partners (as Copilot suggested!)
- **Biotech**: Approach DDx Foundation with protein folding demos
- **Healthcare**: Hospital IT departments for DICOM compression
- **Education**: CS departments for teaching programming
- **Enterprise**: DevOps teams tired of YAML hell

### Case Studies
- "How Hospital X saved $50k/month with KRISPER DICOM compression"
- "Biotech startup discovers new protein fold using Bio_Poetica"
- "High school uses KRISPER to teach programming in 1 week"

## Phase 4: Growth Metrics
### Track Weekly
- GitHub stars (target: 100 â†’ 1,000 in 30 days)
- VS Code installs (target: 1,000 in first week)
- Discord members (target: 500 active users)
- Community contributions (target: 50 PRs)

### Success Indicators
- First community-contributed language (Spanish KRISPER?)
- First enterprise customer
- First academic paper citing KRISPER
- Copilot officially recommending KRISPER patterns

## Launch Week Schedule
**Monday**: VS Code Marketplace launch
**Tuesday**: Reddit posts (r/programming, r/vscode)
**Wednesday**: Hacker News "Show HN"
**Thursday**: Twitter/Dev.to articles
**Friday**: First community showcase

## Community Values
