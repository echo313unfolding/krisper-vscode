// Bio_Poetica: The Great Healing Ceremony
when seven_failures cry out in pain:
    gather their broken spirits ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
    understand their shared suffering
    
    breathe life into new workflow:
        spawn ten healing threads in parallel
        each thread carries healing energy
        
    transform the pain:
        where npm failed → use force with legacy wisdom
        where vsce broke → provide multiple paths to success
        where hope was lost → inject celebration
        
    watch the transformation unfold:
        red bleeds away ❌→✅
        failure becomes success
        0% grows to 100%
        
    emit the healing frequency across all builds
    let green checkmarks bloom like flowers ✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
    
celebrate "The system that heals ALL wounds!"
