# 🤝 KRISPER + Bio_Poetica with GitHub Copilot

## KRISPER Plain English Examples

### Example 1: Data Processing
```krisper
// Start typing and Copilot suggests completions!
compress file "report.pdf" as backup
// Copilot might suggest: → using seed=42

filter data where sales > 1000
// Copilot might suggest: → as high_value_sales

email results to "boss@company.com"
// Copilot might suggest: → with subject "Daily Report"
```

### Example 2: File Operations
```krisper
// Type "load" and Copilot suggests:
load csv file "customers.csv" as data
sort data by revenue descending
export top 10 to "vip_customers.json"

// Copilot learns your patterns!
compress all logs older than 7 days
archive compressed logs to "backup/2024/"
delete original logs after confirmation
```

## Bio_Poetica Cross-Language Examples

### Example 3: Event-Driven Poetry
```bio
// Bio_Poetica - Write once, run in ANY language!
when user clicks button:
    // Copilot suggests biological metaphors:
    breathe life into animation
    grow happiness by 10
    emit sparkle with golden particles
    flow into next state

when error occurs:
    // Copilot learns your poetic style:
    pulse red warning 
    cascade error to handler
    compress stacktrace as dna
    heal system with retry
```

### Example 4: Biological Algorithms
```bio
// Fibonacci with biological metaphors
function fibonacci evolves:
    seed a = 0, b = 1
    // Copilot suggests the pattern:
    cycle 10 times:
        bloom c from a + b
        flow b to a  
        flow c to b
    return final bloom

// Database operations as biology
when database connects:
    // Copilot understands context:
    breathe life into connection pool
    grow threads to match load
    maintain heartbeat every 30 seconds
```

## 🎯 Copilot Integration Features

### Smart Completions
```krisper
// Type: compress
// Copilot suggests: compress [file|data|logs|payload] "name" as output

// Type: filter  
// Copilot suggests: filter [data|results|items] where condition

// Type: when
// Copilot suggests: when [user|system|error|timer] event:
```

### Pattern Learning
```bio
// After writing a few Bio_Poetica functions, Copilot learns:
// - Your preferred biological verbs (grow, bloom, flow)
// - Your event handling style
// - Your error handling patterns

function process_data flows:
    // Copilot autocompletes in your style!
    absorb input from stream
    filter through golden ratio
    crystallize at entropy 9.04
    return compressed wisdom
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Copilot + KRISPER

1. **Start with verbs** - Copilot recognizes KRISPER verbs instantly
2. **Use consistent patterns** - Copilot learns and suggests your style
3. **Mix languages** - Write Bio_Poetica that transforms to any language
4. **Let Copilot help** - It understands both plain English and biological metaphors

## Real-World Example: API Handler
```bio
// Bio_Poetica API handler - Copilot helps write the flow
when request arrives at "/api/users":
    // Copilot suggests authentication:
    validate bearer token in header
    
    branch on request method:
        if GET: flow all users to response
        if POST: absorb new user from body
        if DELETE: wilt user gently
        
    // Copilot knows to add error handling:
    on error: emit status 500 with message
    finally: close database connection
```
