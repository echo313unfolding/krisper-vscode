// KRISPER's Final Self-Healing Fix
// This time it WILL work!

disable broken workflow "vsce.yml"
create new workflow "build.yml" with:
    use ubuntu-latest
    install node 20
    run "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
    run "vsce package --no-dependencies --allow-missing-repository"
    celebrate "KRISPER built successfully!"

// The system that persists until it succeeds!
commit message "KRISPER learns from failure and heals again! ðŸ§¬âœ¨"
push to origin master

// Meta-lesson: Even self-healing code needs iteration!
