## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: KRISPER â€“ write programs in English (works with Copilot)

**Body:**
Hi HN! I built KRISPER because I was tired of translating thoughts into syntax. 

With KRISPER, you write:
```
compress file "data.txt" as backup
compare backup with original
```

Instead of remembering APIs, brackets, and semicolons.

Key points:
- Works alongside GitHub Copilot (not a replacement)
- Compiles to JSON intermediate representation
- VS Code extension with syntax highlighting
- Open source: https://github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

Would love your feedback on the approach and what verbs you'd want to see!

## Reddit (r/programming)

**Title:** I made a VS Code extension that lets you code in plain English (and it works with Copilot)

**Post:**
Hey r/programming!

Just released KRISPER - a natural language programming interface that transforms English into executable code.

**What it does:**
- Write `compress data as backup` instead of complex compression APIs
- One-keystroke compilation (Ctrl+Shift+K) to see the IR
- Works WITH GitHub Copilot, not against it
- Supports "Bio_Poetica" mode for poetic code

**Demo:** [GIF showing quickstart â†’ compile â†’ execute]

**GitHub:** https://github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER  
**VS Code:** [marketplace link]

The philosophy: Every programming language is just a bad translation layer between human thought and machine execution. KRISPER removes the translation.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation or natural language parsing approach!

**Tweet 1:**
Just shipped KRISPER ðŸš€

Write code in plain English:
```
compress file "data.txt" as backup
```

No brackets. No semicolons. Just intent.

Works WITH GitHub Copilot, not against it.

**Tweet 2:**
Traditional coding:
- Remember syntax
- Look up APIs  
- Debug typos

KRISPER coding:
- Write what you want
- Press Ctrl+Shift+K
- It runs

**Tweet 3:**
Available now:
âœ… VS Code extension
âœ… Open source
âœ… Copilot-compatible
âœ… Poetry mode (Bio_Poetica)

GitHub: github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

The future: humans write intent, not syntax.

ðŸŽ¯ Launching KRISPER: Natural Language Programming for VS Code

After months of development, I'm excited to share KRISPER - a tool that lets developers write code in plain English.

**The Problem:** We spend too much time translating ideas into syntax.

**The Solution:** Write your intent directly:
- "compress file as backup"
- "filter data where amount > 1000"
- "export results to json"

**Key Innovation:** KRISPER works alongside GitHub Copilot, enhancing AI-assisted development rather than replacing it.

âœ… VS Code extension now available
âœ… Open source on GitHub
âœ… JSON intermediate representation
âœ… One-click compilation and execution

This is just the beginning of making programming more accessible and intuitive.
