**Title:** I made a VS Code extension that lets you code in plain English - no syntax required!

**Post:**
Hey r/vscode! 

I just released KRISPER - a VS Code extension that lets you write code in plain English. 

Instead of:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('data.txt');
const compressed = zlib.gzipSync(data);
fs.writeFileSync('backup.gz', compressed);
```

You write:
```
compress file "data.txt" as backup
```

Features:
- ✅ Works alongside GitHub Copilot
- ✅ Instant compilation (Ctrl+Shift+K)
- ✅ Direct execution (Ctrl+Shift+Enter)
- ✅ Multiple language backends
- ✅ Bio_Poetica mode for artistic code

Install: `ext install echo-labs.krisper`

GitHub: https://github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

Would love your feedback!

**Title:** Tired of syntax? I built a plain English programming language for VS Code

**Post:**
After years of watching beginners struggle with syntax, I built KRISPER - a natural language programming interface.

Example KRISPER code:
```
load csv file "sales.csv" as data
filter data where amount > 1000 as high_value
compress high_value as report
email report to "boss@company.com"
```

It compiles to an intermediate representation (IR) that can execute across multiple backends.

The interesting part: it's deterministic (no AI), so the same English always produces the same code.

VS Code extension: `ext install echo-labs.krisper`
GitHub: https://github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

Technical details in the repo. Curious what you think about natural language as a programming interface?

## Twitter/X Thread
**Tweet 1:**
🚀 Just launched KRISPER for VS Code!

Write code in plain English:
"compress all logs older than 7 days"

No syntax. No semicolons. Just intent.

Works with @GitHubCopilot too! 🤝

Install: ext install echo-labs.krisper

🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
Traditional coding:
```js
fs.readdirSync('./logs')
  .filter(f => Date.now() - fs.statSync(f).mtime > 7*24*60*60*1000)
  .forEach(f => compress(f))
```

KRISPER:
```
compress all logs older than 7 days
```

Same result. Zero syntax errors. 

**Tweet 3:**
Perfect for:
✅ Beginners learning to code
✅ Quick scripts & automation  
✅ Documenting what code does
✅ Prototyping ideas fast

**Title:** How I Built a Plain English Programming Language for VS Code

**Tags:** #vscode #programming #opensource #showdev

I've always been frustrated watching smart people give up on coding because of syntax. So I built KRISPER - a VS Code extension that lets you write code in plain English.

## The Problem
Every beginner struggles with:
- Missing semicolons
- Mismatched brackets  
- Confusing error messages
- Language-specific syntax

## The Solution
What if you could just write what you want?

```krisper
// KRISPER code
compress file "report.pdf" using maximum compression
upload compressed file to "backup.company.com"
email link to "team@company.com" with subject "Report ready"
```

## How It Works
1. **Parser**: Extracts intent from natural language
2. **IR Compiler**: Converts to intermediate representation  
3. **Executors**: Run the IR on various backends
4. **VS Code Integration**: Syntax highlighting, compilation, execution

## Try It!
Install: `ext install echo-labs.krisper`

GitHub: https://github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

I'd love to hear your thoughts on natural language programming!

## Hacker News
**Title:** Show HN: KRISPER – Write code in plain English (VS Code extension)

**Link:** https://github.com/echo313unfolding/KRISPER

**Comment:**
Hi HN! I built KRISPER to explore natural language as a programming interface. 

It's not AI-based - it uses deterministic parsing to convert English to an intermediate representation (IR) that executes on multiple backends.

The VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting, instant compilation (Ctrl+Shift+K), and direct execution.

Interesting challenges solved:
- Ambiguity resolution without AI
- Maintaining determinism 
- GitHub Copilot compatibility
- Multi-language backend support

Would love feedback on the approach!
