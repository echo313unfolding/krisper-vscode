# ðŸš€ VS Code Marketplace Publishing Steps

Your extension is now on GitHub! To get it on the VS Code Marketplace:

## Step 1: Create Publisher Account
1. Go to: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Create publisher ID: `echo-labs`
4. You'll need to verify your account

## Step 2: Package Your Extension
Since vsce is having issues, here's the manual approach:

1. Create a .vsix file:
   ```bash
   cd /home/voidstr3m33/krisper-vscode
   zip -r krisper-vscode.vsix *
   ```

2. Or use the web interface (easier!)

## Step 3: Publish via Web Interface
1. Go to: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/echo-labs
2. Click "New Extension"
3. Click "Upload"
4. Select your krisper-vscode folder
5. Fill in the details
6. Publish!

- **GitHub Copilot**: Full compatibility

## After Publishing:
