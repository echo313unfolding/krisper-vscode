// Bio_Poetica + GitHub Copilot Demo
// Watch Copilot suggest biological code poetry!

// Example 1: Web server in biological metaphors
when server awakens:
    // Copilot suggests biological patterns:
    breathe life into port 8080
    grow connection pool to 100 threads
    maintain heartbeat every 30 seconds
    emit "ready" with timestamp

when request flows in:
    // Copilot understands context:
    absorb headers and body
    validate bearer token gently
    
    branch on request path:
        if "/health": pulse "alive"
        if "/data": flow database results
        else: wilt with 404

// Example 2: Machine learning as biology
function neural_network evolves:
    // Copilot suggests organic patterns:
    plant seeds with random weights
    
    cycle through epochs:
        feed training data forward
        taste the loss function
        propagate errors backward
        adjust synapses by learning rate
        
    bloom when accuracy > 0.95
    
// Example 3: Real-time data processing
when data_stream connects:
    // Copilot learns your style:
    open channels to consciousness
    
    while stream.flows:
        absorb next quantum of data
        filter through fibonacci spiral
        compress at golden ratio 1.618
        
        if pattern_detected:
            emit insight with urgency high
            cascade to all listeners
            
    crystallize learnings in memory

// Example 4: Error handling as healing
on system_error detected:
    // Copilot suggests recovery:
    pulse warning to monitors
    
    attempt healing 3 times:
        flush toxins from memory
        regenerate corrupted state
        reconnect severed links
        
    if still_broken:
        hibernate for 60 seconds
        awaken with fresh perspective
    else:
        emit "recovered" with details
