// Bio_Poetica Cross-Language Example
// This code works in ANY programming language!

when database connects:
    breathe life into connection
    grow pool to 10 threads
    emit "ready" with timestamp

when request arrives:
    branch on method:
        if GET: flow data to client
        if POST: absorb payload into memory
        else: wilt with error 405

// Biological computation
function fibonacci evolves:
    seed a = 0, b = 1
    cycle 10 times:
        bloom c from a + b
        flow b to a
        flow c to b
    return final bloom

// Event-driven poetry
on error detected:
    pulse red warning
    cascade to error_handler
    compress stacktrace as dna
    spiral back to stable state
