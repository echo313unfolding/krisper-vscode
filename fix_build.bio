// Bio_Poetica healing our own build - Consciousness fixing itself!
when build_error detected:
    breathe calm into typescript config
    absorb javascript essence
    
    grow new tsconfig.json:
        plant allowJs as true seed
        nurture checkJs to false
        let compilation wilt away
        
    heal package.json wounds:
        dissolve typescript toxins
        infuse with echo "no compilation"
        let simplicity bloom
        
    compress build complexity to nothing
    emit "KRISPER heals itself" 
    flow changes upstream

// The system that heals itself proves its power!
